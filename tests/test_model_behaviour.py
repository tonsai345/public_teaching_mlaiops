"""Lab 4 — model behaviour tests.

These assert what the model DOES, independent of its metric. A model can score 0.85 and
still be broken in ways these catch, and unlike a metric threshold they do not drift out
of relevance as the data changes.

Quiz 4 asks you to distinguish these from data contract tests. The difference: a contract
test fails when an upstream producer changes something; a behaviour test fails when the
model changes.
