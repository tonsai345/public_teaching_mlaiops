# ITCS355 — Course Materials

Everything a student needs to read, in one place. The code they run lives one level up, in
the repository root.

**ITCS355 Machine Learning Operation and Deployment** · 1(1-0-2) · Faculty of ICT, Mahidol
University · 5 sessions × 3 hours + final week

## Read in this order

0. **Week 0 setup, step by step.** Pick **one** provider and stay on it for the term:
   **[`getting-started-gcp.md`](getting-started-gcp.md)** (cheaper registry; the free trial
   wants a credit card) or **[`getting-started-azure.md`](getting-started-azure.md)** (credit
   from your university email, no card; the registry bills daily). Either takes you from an
   empty laptop to a finished Lab 1, and both assume minimum access — one subscription or
   project, basic permissions, a small budget.
1. **[`reference/cloud-portability-reference.md`](reference/cloud-portability-reference.md)**
   — before anything else. Defines the contract that makes every lab work on AWS, Azure, or
   GCP, and contains the Week 0 setup checklist.
2. **[`../README.md`](../README.md)** — the repository you will actually work in.
   Deeper detail in [`../docs/REPO-GUIDE.md`](../docs/REPO-GUIDE.md).
3. Your current lab handout, from `labs/`.
4. **[`project/project-brief.md`](project/project-brief.md)** — read it after Session 2, not
   in the final week.

## Assessment at a glance

| Component | Marks | CLO1 / CLO2 / CLO3 |
|---|---|---|
| Capstone demo & defense | 15 | 5 / 5 / 5 |
| Capstone System | 30 | 10 / 10 / 10 |
| In-class drills (5 × 3) | 15 | 5 / 5 / 5 |
| Labs (5 × 8) | 40 | 15 / 15 / 10 |
| **Total** | **100** | **35 / 35 / 30** |

**There is no final examination.** The capstone is worth 45 across two lines: the five rubric
criteria score 30 as **Capstone System**, and the live demo and defence scores 15 as
**Capstone demo & defense**.

**Labs are marked directly**, 8 marks each, against the acceptance criteria in each handout.
A lab either meets them or it does not — there is no partial credit for a service that almost
deploys. At 40 marks the labs are the single largest component: this course is graded on what
you build and operate, not on what you can recall.

**In-class drills** run at the start of each session, 3 marks each. They carry evidence
questions drawn from your own lab output: your p95 figure, your run ID, the true cause behind
your drift alert. So a copied lab earns nothing in the drill. The labs also compound, which
means skipping Lab 1 makes Lab 3 impossible.

**Model accuracy is not graded anywhere.** A 0.71 AUC model with clean lineage, a working
rollback, and an honest cost report outscores a 0.94 model that only runs on its author's
laptop.

Full allocation is on the **Assessment Blueprint** sheet —
readable as [`spec/course-specification.md`](spec/course-specification.md), authoritative as
[`spec/Course_Specification_ITCS355_merged.xlsx`](spec/Course_Specification_ITCS355_merged.xlsx).

## Cloud platform

The labs are written provider-neutral and work on **AWS, Azure, or GCP**. You pick one in
Week 0 and stay on it. Your choice does not affect your marks: the grader only ever calls
the neutral interface defined in the portability reference.

Target spend for the term is under 800 THB. Every lab ends with a teardown step, and
teardown is checked.
