"""The portability seam.

Eleven methods. Every managed ML platform sells you the same eleven operations under
different names; writing this once is the difference between knowing a product and
knowing the category. `generate` is the newest of them and the one the vendors are
currently busiest renaming.

You implement exactly ONE of aws.py, azure.py, or gcp.py. Lab 1 needs only `upload`,
`download`, and `push_image`. The rest raise NotImplementedError until the lab that
needs them, which is deliberate — do not implement ahead.

Nothing outside cloudlayer/ may import a provider SDK.
