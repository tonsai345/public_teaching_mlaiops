"""Cost model. Used by Labs 2, 3, and 5.

Prices change and differ by region, so these are STARTING VALUES you must verify against
your provider's calculator. Verifying them is part of Lab 2; citing a stale number without
checking is the kind of thing the cost report is designed to catch.

Rates are THB per hour, on-demand. Discounted (spot / low-priority / preemptible) compute
is roughly 30% of on-demand across all three providers — SPOT_FACTOR below.
